## Task 3
* Objective: forecast your firm's number of available workers using Python (click the black button at the top of the README.md file)
***
You plan to start hiring workers next year. During this very first year, you are its only workers, all managers. Yearly staff movements were, on average, as follows: Out of 15 managers, 5 stayed in the same occupation, 5 moved to operators, and 5 left the firm; Out of 20 engineers, 10 stayed in the same occupation, 2 moved to managers, 5 moved to operators, and 3 left the firm; Out of 50 operators, 45 stayed in the same occupation and 5 left the firm. Using this information, predict how many managers, engineers, and operators you will have company will have in one year from now.
***
First, we have filled matrix M with the 5 managers that stayed as managers, the engineers that passed to managers and no operators passed to managers, in the second row no managers passed to enginneers, 10 stayed as engeneers and no operator passed to engineer, and in the third row, 5 managers passed to work as operators, 5 engineers passed to works as operators and 45 operators stayed as operators. The Matrix D we fill it with the workers htat stayed on the same occupations the last year. In matris b in our firm there are 2 managers, one engeneer and 1 operator. The result we obtained interpreted as intergers is 1 manager, 1 engineer and 2 operators.
## Task 4
* Objective: forecast your firm's need for workers and anticipate mismatches using Python (click the black button at the top of the README.md file)
***
Last three years data on unemployment for managers was 15%, 17% and 14% for managers; 6%, 6%, 5% for engineers; and 23%, 27%, and 25% for operators. Last three years, the need for workers on average and per firm was 4, 6, 5 for managers; 13, 12, 13 for engineers; and 7, 7, 9 for operators. Using this information, predict how many workers your company will need in one year from now for each of its 3 occupations if unemployment is predicted to be 10% for managers, 4% for engineers, and 20% for operators. 

Last but not least, for each occupation, compare your predictions to anticipate mismatches.
***
First we have filled matrix X with the rates of unemployment in the first column, then each column as dummy variables with a 1 or 0, depending on the occupation. Then, we multiplied the X by its traspose, and then we've done the inverse. Finally we multiply the inverse of the product of X and X' by the X' and then by the matrix Y, that is formed by the needed workers of previous year. The result we obtained, we multiplied it by the expected matrix X, that is filled with the expected unemployment in the first column and then the following columns as dummy variables depending on the occupation. The result we finally obtained is a column matrix 4, 12, 7. This means we expect that we will need 4 managers, 12 enginees and 7 operators in a year form now.
There will be a shortage of 3 managers, a shortage of 11 operators and a shortage of 5 operators.
